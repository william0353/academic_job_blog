"""
This is a simple blog website I built to display my current python skills. There are several functions not displayed in this repositories, for example paresing target website, email alert and api etc.

To run this server in your own machine, first install python3 and install the libraries from the requirements.txt

Then find the file "manage.py" and run the follwoing command: python manage.py runserver.

If you would like to make it into a intranet website, the easiest way is run the following command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

The other client could visit your IP:8000 to visit the website.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
